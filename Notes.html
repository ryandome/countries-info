      The table starts with all 250 countries sorted alphabetically and their respective flag.
      You can click on the flag of any of the countries and it will create new columns in the table that reveal new information
      about the countries. At the top of the page there are buttons that allow you to sort the data in a variety of ways.
      You can sort them from greatest to least in terms of their area and population or from least to greatest in terms of area
      and population. If you would like to view the original table you can click the button for alphabetically and it will sort 
      the table alphabetically by country name. The category for population density was not a part of our api, but we where able to use
      the country areas and populations given to us in the api to calculate this value. We then found the average population density 
      for all countries in the world. If a country's population density appears in a light red table cell then that means the country has
      a population density that is above average.
